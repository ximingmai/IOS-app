# Cilly
This app orients to the beginer in C++. We wish to change the method of how starter learn coding. In this app, we will try our best to create a new environment for starter to accept C++ programming thoughts. Beautiful, easy-understanding, focus on information, are what we want to share in this app. It is a hard work for us. But just keep going, believe ourselves.

# what about this repository
It is a repository of our project, Cilly-Learn how to code in C++. In this repository, we will save codes, designing diagrams and whatever description file. In summary, you can find any information in this repository. What's more, I hope that every members in this team can have a full understanding of how to manage a project, and we can learn together.

# codes
In the folder, codes, we will save every code files. Because we will use Xcode storyboard in this project, but storyboard is really hard to cooperate remotely. That's a hard question which needs we all to discuss how to solve with.

# designing diagram
In the folder, designing diagram, we will save every designing diagrams. We have to be carefully to put designing diagram of different views in different folders so that we can manage the project easily.

# knowledge point
In the folder, knowledge point, we will put the teaching plan of what we can to share in this app.  We all use Markdown to write teaching plan.
